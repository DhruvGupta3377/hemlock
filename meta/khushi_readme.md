# Model Pipeline
## link to git repo for explanation [here](https://github.com/Khushibansal15/capstone).
## Steps:

1. **Dataset Collection**  
   - Collect original artworks dataset from FAPS , accessing wikiart[here](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/style-transfer-on-wikiart).
   
2. **Style Transfer**
   - Implement style transfer using techniques mentioned [here](https://paperswithcode.com/task/styletransfer) and [here](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/neural-style-transfer).
   
3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Extract features utilizing models from the stable diffusion model available [here](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion).
   
4. **Cloaking Techniques**
   - Apply Fawkes cloaking techniques, particularly suited for facial features, as described [here](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/fawkes-protecting-personal-privacy-against).
   
5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Define and apply evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of the model.
   - study about these (perceptual metrics)
